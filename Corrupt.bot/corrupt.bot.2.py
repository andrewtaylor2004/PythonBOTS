###The C++ and C# code are being developed by Phil
### On a computer that is not in School
### and that has a "LEGAL" copy of Microsoft
### Visual Studio.
###
### Also the JavaScript scripts may/may not be replaced with
### some Ruby Scripts.
###
### Or maybe I will keep JS and add Ruby aswell
### Batch and Visual Basic Script coding is being added
